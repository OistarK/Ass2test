                <h2>About My Games</h2>
                    <p>I have been designing games since I was eight, I begun making board game designs using textas and pizza box cardboard. For over a decade this love and
                        fascination for games has continued to grow, bridging over into digital games as well. <br><br> While I am interested in all facets of creating a game, design and art
                        are my main areas of practice. My games are often focused and designed around themes, prompts and
                        stories which I feel work well to entice the development of a supportive mechanical system to exist alongside the former elements in a strong dialogue. <br><br>
                        I want to create games which are fun, intriguing, and which work to legitimise games as an artistic medium, capable of expressing narratives, questioning realities, and evoking
                        strong responses from audiences. You can view my some of my most developed projects below or on my Itch.io page.

                    <!-- using placeholder image, real image adjusted as required  -->
                    <p>Project Top Out is a game about building an increasingly stupid robot to climb an increasingly difficult wall. This game was created as a collaboration between myself and friends as part of the GMTK 2024 game jam, prompted only by the phrase "built to scale". 
                        This project was made entirely in 4 days, in which I acted as the lead artist for the game assets. Throughout this project my friends and I had to maintain frequent and effective communication to achieve our successful outcome. You can give the game a go through
                        my itch.io page.

                <h2>Stormwater</h2>
                    <img src="images/stormwater.png" alt="stormwater board game images" width="1200" height="400">
                    <!-- using placeholder image, real image adjusted as required  -->
                    <p>Stormwater is my current and largest board game project which I have been slowley developing over the last year. It has been developed using a combination of physical and digital prototypes, and while many elements are still using placeholder art, the images above are all my own. I have also been given the opportunity to playtest stormwater with the public at Swancon in Perth!
                        <br><br>Stormwater is a twisted and unsettling farming game taking place upon the sea swept fields of the Netherlands' coast spanning the turn of the 17th to 18th century. Players take control of the workers and happenings of a humble farm, striving to survive harsher
                         and harsher winters through the production of crops and raising of animals. While doing so players will suffer the fear inducing corruption of the North Sea's dark denizens as they balance the scales between survival and sanity. <br><br> Stormwater is a game about facing dilemmas, putting your faith in your friends, and then living with the often cruel consequences. </p>

                    <!-- using placeholder image, real image adjusted as required  -->
                    <p>One Must Remain is a small digital single player puzzle game I created as a solo project as part of a game jam hosted by a friend of mine. The theme of the jam was simply the word "must". The game involves moving bugs around on a grid, each bug has a different and limited move set and some also have abilities. The goal is to get the bugs to eat one another until one remains. To do this the player must work out the optimal order to move the bugs around so that each may be eaten by another.
