            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I have lived in the isoated city of Perth, WA, all my life. Born to two artists/teachers I have spent a large majority of my life absorbed in the world of art, dragged from gallery to gallery across Australia and Europe.
                    To keep their child enterained on these overseas outings they bestowed upon me a DS when I was four. Ever since i've been playing and designing games. In highschool I discovered my love of board games, theatre, roleplaying games and visual arts, and was
                    fortunate enough to find and befriend like-minded people to whom I owe a great deal for their support and creativity over the last decade.

            <h2>My Vision and Practice</h2>
                <p>My vision for my work practices is to create a small, independant game studio in which I am able to produce quality games both in the digital and tabletop spheres. Ideally these games address themes which I am passionate about, and take an artistic approch to game design highlighted by strong storytelling and thematic elements generated by
                    mechanical systems which work to emphasise these ideas to audiences.<br><br> Ideally this studio would gain funding from grant applications and crowdsourcing in order to develop its work and invite a community to come together around it. As there is a large demand for it in numerous industries, I might also produce games which are pedagogical in nature 
                    along side more entertainment focused games for the purposes of consolidating a more viable income stream. With my skills being in design and art, it is likely I would need to have others working at this studio to develop other elements of games, or outsource elements to freelancers if work cannot be done in house. </p>
